This is a clone from https://github.com/candera/hobocopy.
But it does not work in Win7 just because incorrect compile settings.

So i build with Visual Studio 2015 Community. Works for Windows 7 x64. (x86 also provided, but not tested).

Sample:

HoboCopy_Win7_64bit.exe c:\Windows\System32\config D:\xxx Security
This will copy "c:\Windows\System32\config\Security" to D:\xxx\Security.
